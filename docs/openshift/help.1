.SS Deploy and register the broker
.PP
.RS

.nf
### Create a directory named hlssb
mkdir hlssb

### Change directory to hlssb
cd hlssb

### Fetch installation artifacts
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heremaps/here\-hls\-service\-broker/release\-v1.0.0/deploy/openshift/deployment.sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heremaps/here\-hls\-service\-broker/release\-v1.0.0/deploy/openshift/hls\-service\-broker.yaml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heremaps/here\-hls\-service\-broker/release\-v1.0.0/deploy/openshift/parameters.env

### Edit parameters.env and update the following parameters. Leave all other parameters as is.
# 1. HERE App Id/App Code acquired from prerequisites step.
# 2. Docker Image name
# 3. If required change BASIC\_AUTH\_USERNAME and BASIC\_AUTH\_PASSWORD
# 3. Highly recommend to change default BASIC\_AUTH\_USERNAME and BASIC\_AUTH\_PASSWORD properties. These credentials are required to register the broker with the OpenShift container catalog.

vi parameters.env

### Change deployment.sh execute permission
chmod +x deployment.sh

### Execute the deployment script
### By default the below script creates a project named hls\-sb. If this needs to be changed, modify the deployment.sh file
./deployment.sh

### check that the broker is running:
oc get pods | grep hls\-service\-broker

### check service broker logs
oc logs $(oc get pods \-\-no\-headers \-o name | grep hls\-service\-broker)

### Check if the broker service is up and running
curl <broker\-url>/actuator/health

.SH Provisioning \- Service Instance Creation
.PP
Once the deployment and registration steps are executed, the OpenShift Cluster Service Catalog will show the "HERE Location Services" as a catalog listing.
To create a Service Instance for HERE Location Services, select the "HERE Location Services" listing and follow the instructions.

.SH Binding \- Create credentials
.PP
Binding creation option is provided during the instance creation step which can be used to create the binding along with the instance creation.
Alternately, binding can be created separately from the OpenShift Web UI as follows:

.RS
.IP \(bu 2
Navigate to the project in which the instance has been created.
.IP \(bu 2
Navigate to the "Applications" menu and select "Provisioned Services".
.IP \(bu 2
Click on the "Create Binding" option and follow the instructions to create the binding.
.IP \(bu 2
Provide an optional binding name in the configuration step. This binding name will be used to name the app created at HERE end for the binding.
.IP \(bu 2
Once binding is done a Secret will be created which can be used to invoke the HLS APIs.

.RE

.SH Un\-binding \- Delete credentials
.PP
When the binding is no longer needed, it can be deleted from the same place it was created at.

.SH Un\-provisioning \- Delete instance
.PP
When the HLS Service instance is no longer required, it can be deleted from the "Provisioned Services" under "Applications" menu.
